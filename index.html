# Project 1: Command Line and Intro to Node.js

## Overview
This project introduced the fundamentals of using the **Command Line Interface (CLI)** and working with **Node.js** in a non-web server environment. The goal was to get comfortable with the terminal, basic CLI commands, folder navigation, and JavaScript file execution.
